.SH DESCRIPTION
Any \fBsuds\fR structure may have a comment structure
associated with it that contains an ASCII string of any length up to 65536
bytes describing the structure or one or more members of the structure.  Only
one comment is available per instance of a structure.  The same comment may
refer to many instances of one type of structure.  Comments must refer to a
specific member of the structure and thus must be prefaced with \fB{name}\fR
where \fBname\fR is the name of the member.  Thus a comment about a \fBpick\fR
structure might be "{signal_2_noise} waveform very irregular, possible
telemetry spikes {onset_type} quite debatable {gain_range} unable to tell if
gain ranged".
.LP
Comments should be written and accessed through the subroutines described in
\fBmake_comment(2)\fR.
.PP
A comment may contain any ASCII characters except \fB{\fR or \fB}\fR which
are reserved for labeling. If either of these characters are included in a comment
string passed to any of the \fBmake_comment(2)\fR routines, they will
be converted to a \fB[\fR or \fB]\fR respectively. If they are put in a comment
by other means, they may confuse the \fBmake_comment(2)\fR routines. 
.PP
There is no required format for the contents of comments. Thus it is
recommended that they only be used for free-form descriptions and NOT
as a place to encode important information to be read by a computer
program.

divisable by 8.
