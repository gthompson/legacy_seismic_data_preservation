BASIC STRUCTURES contain ALL information about a logical entity that
is time independent or varies very slowly with time.  Typically
used in a one to many relationship.

ASSOCIATIVE STRUCTURES associate two basic structures generally in
a time-dependent manner.  Typically for a many-to-many relationship
between structures.
